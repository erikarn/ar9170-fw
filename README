Atheros ar9170 firmware
-----------------------

This is the firmware for the Atheros ar9170 802.11n devices.

To build the firmware you will need an SH-2 toolchain:

 1) You can build your own toolchain:

    make -C toolchain

    but be aware that this will take some time and requires
    about 1.2 GiB disk space.

 2) You can download an SH-2 gcc toolchain from KPIT:

The resulting firmware, ar9170.fw, can be used with the ar9170 Linux
driver through the standard request_firmware() API. You will need
ar9170 with 1-stage firmware support (this was recently added to
wireless-testing).

After getting a toolchain, simply build and install:

make
sudo make install
