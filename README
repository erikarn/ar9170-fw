Atheros ar9170 firmware
-------------------------

This is the firmware for the Atheros ar9170 802.11n devices.
To build the firmware you will need an SH-2 toolchain.

Toolchain being used
--------------------

You can download an SH-2 gcc toolchain from KPIT:

Alternative older toolchains
----------------------------

http://www.sh-linux.org/
http://rpm.sh-linux.org/rpm-fc6/RPMS/i386/

A mirror of these RPMs and converted Debian packages are also available at:

Notes
-----

The target binary is not ELF, its built using --oformat binary. The target
host is SH2 little endian.

The resulting firmware, ar9170.fw, can be used with the ar9170 Linux
driver through the standard request_firmware() API. You will need
ar9170 with 1-stage firmware support (this was recently added to
wireless-testing).

This built firmware does not yet work, work is needed to get the start
routine at the right address.

STA/AP support could be merged, most code is shared. We have split up the
files into two directories one for STA and one for AP. Most work has been
done for STA to get it to compile correctly.

Build and install
-----------------

make
make fw
sudo make install
